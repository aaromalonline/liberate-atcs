# **Liberate**  
### *Freedom Beyond Barriers*  

**Liberate** is a muscle movement detection system that converts subtle muscle activity into control signals. By detecting slight facial or body muscle movements, the system enables users to control devices like a **computer cursor, wheelchair, or keyboard**. This innovation offers an intuitive, hands-free interface, enhancing accessibility and communication for individuals with limited mobility.

**UPDATE STAGE** - Prototype

[Presentation](https://bit.ly/3XrDsM3)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** for signal processing & control logic
- **ESP32** for sensor data acquisition via I2C and encoding of muscle twitches to control signals
- **ADXL345 Digital Accelerometer/Tap Sensor** for muscle movement detection (also IR reflexive sensor)

## 🚀 Features
- **Muscle twitch detector/encoder** using ADXL345 digital accelerometer & ESP32 to convert muscle twitches to control signals/clicks
- **Muscle controlled keyboard** with QWERTY & Morse mode available as a PyQt5 python desktop
- **Built-in SOS & speech synthesis** using a specch engine like gTTS
- **A minimal, cost-effective design** for real-world usability

💻 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐈𝐭 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬:
- **Sensor + Encoder** - When ON, The ADXL345 accelerometer records muscle twitches as 3-axis accelerations, which are encoded into clicks (0/1) using baseline calibration and filtering algorithms.
- **Data Transmission** - Data is sent serially/wirelessly via ESP32 to the python application, where the user can control a keyboard interface using the decoded twitch clicks.
- The system operates serially or wirelessly utilising **I2C communication**.
